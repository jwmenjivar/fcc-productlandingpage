Hello folks, this a special entry dedicated to the old me who's likely to be sneaking in this notes in the present year.

Dear old me, this is the young you, in the present everything seems to be possible but quite difficult.
As you might remember, your trip to San Francisco changed it all. 
I really hope what you have become is what I expected you to be.

Fulfilled and happy.

You have changed many things, but esentially you can't change. Is that essence that makes you, be you, no matter what personality you add(those are functional so keep 'em like that) you know who you are, and that doesn't change with tons of money nor with the lack of it.

Is that essence what brought you back to this old file. Probably looking for inspiration.

Whatever problem you face, except for loss due to fatility, is nothing compared to allllllll the struggles I am at the moment I write this. Struggles that you faced! and did GOOD AT.

So here's your inspiration quote.

"F$#@ OFF and GET BACK TO WORK"
